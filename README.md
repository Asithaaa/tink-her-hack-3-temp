### The Problem statement
In today's fast-paced world, people often struggle to find the best shops, services, and deals in their locality. Whether it's a grocery store, a fashion boutique, a hardware shop, or a restaurant, users need a quick and convenient way to explore available options without having to manually search for them.
Currently, there is no centralized platform that provides real-time, location-based information about all shops in a given locality. Users often rely on word-of-mouth, scattered online reviews, or multiple apps to find relevant shops and their offers. This results in:

Wasted time searching for nearby shops manually
Lack of awareness about new or trending stores in the area
Difficulty in comparing different stores based on ratings, prices, and services
Missed deals and discounts due to the absence of a unified platform

### The Solution
ShopSphere is an innovative location-based shop discovery app that provides users with real-time information about all shops in their locality. By accessing the user‚Äôs GPS location, the app will:

Show a categorized list of nearby shops (Grocery, Fashion, Electronics, Restaurants, etc.).
Display shop details, including address, contact info, operating hours, and customer reviews.
Highlight special offers, discounts, and deals from various stores.
Allow users to search and filter shops based on preferences (e.g., "best-rated cafes nearby").
Provide navigation assistance to reach the desired shop.
